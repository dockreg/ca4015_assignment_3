## General Information
- This project aims to explore recommender systems using code available via Google's introduction to recommender systems using Google Colab [_here_](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/eng-edu/blob/main/ml/recommendation-systems/recommendation-systems.ipynb?utm_source=ss-recommendation-systems&utm_campaign=colab-external&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=recommendation-systems#scrollTo=eSfW6SwIo4tk)
- The goal is to create a executable jupyter notebook which will recommend an artist to a user based on their previous listening habits.

## Project Status
Project is: in progress

## Lyric retrieval
This music recommender system also has a novel lyric retrieval system using the ```lyrics genius``` API to display the lyrics of any song entered into the program.

## Room for Improvement
The recommender system could be improved to increase the quality of artists that it decides as similar. There seems to be some issues with the recommendations and the use of weightings and their values need to be further inspected in the future. We would also like to do further work on the lyrics display to make it more interactive using videos, or text coming across images.
